<p><h3>Pros using Netlify:</h3>
    - Netlify was very cheap and easy to follow for basic design of website
    - Easy to set up - Neat user interface - Free Netlify domain - Debugging
    logs - Custom domains - Github integration
    - Netlify is easier to use and helps deploy static website from Github/Gitlab
    within minutes. Netlify functions are an amazing thing , they can help you
    to automate a lot of things on your website
    - I liked how easy it is to integrate with GitHub and GitLab. Also, Netlify has
    some inbuilt features like forms and submissions which make it a good
    choice. Also, other features like analytics and functions is a nice feature<br>
   
    - Had to build something quick for marketing purpose. Used to use Heroku
    for small apps, but since this only has frontend react js code, so I gave
    netlify a try, and I was simply amazed by how simple and at the same
    time flexible on how to deploy an app<br>

    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    - There are many cons as this is not a beginner friendly platform for a
    website. You must know how to code and integrate the features on the
    website
    - The UI to manage builds and custom domains is really easy and
    straightforward to use and operate and maintain
    - If you pull the wrong repo in, you can't fix it or remove it. So you end up
    with multiple sites that are nearly the same
    - If they removed the bandwidth limit(100GB per month), time limit(300
    minutes) on uploads and made deployment faster, Netlify would be much
    better
    Netlify offers a free publishing environment and a domain, though there’s
    naturally a possibility to buy a more comprehensive service as well. I made a
    conclusion that this service might be suitable for someone who has already a bit
    of experience on coding and has a multifaceted view on web publishing
    practises. Seems to be quite popular amongst professional developers. Suitable
    for creating web apps and sites.
    As a beginner I would rather pick another publishing platform at this moment.
